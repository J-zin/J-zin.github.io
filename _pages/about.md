About me
======
I am a last-year B.E student at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by [Qinliang Su](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/3796). My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in Bayesian statistics, deep latent variable model, graph structure learning and their applications on natural language.
